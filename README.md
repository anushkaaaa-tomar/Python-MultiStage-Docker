# Multistage Dockerfile Example for Flask Application

This repository demonstrates the use of a multistage Dockerfile to build and package a Flask backend application. Multistage builds are used to optimize the final Docker image size and improve security.

#Introduction--

Modern application deployments often involve containerizing both the backend and frontend components. This project focuses on using a multistage Dockerfile to efficiently build a Flask backend application, creating a lightweight and secure Docker image.


# Dockerfile Explanation
The multistage Dockerfile consists of two build stages, each optimized for a specific purpose.

Stage 1: Build the Flask Application
Use a Python base image to build the Flask backend.
Copy the backend source code and install dependencies.
Build the Flask application.


Stage 2: Final Image
Use a minimal Python base image for the final image.
Copy the built backend from Stage 1.
Expose the necessary port and start the Flask application.
